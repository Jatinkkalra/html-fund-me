When Building dApps, you usually have 2 repos:
1. Smart Contract aka Backend repo
2. Website aka Frontend repo

Full Stack = Smart Contract (backend) + Html / JS / Website (frontend)


Setup:
Use `!` to get boiler plate in `index.html`
Create "./index.js" file to write website script, then import it via "<script src="./index.js">"
In console: `yarn add --dev prettier` and create file "./prettierrc" if required.
Create "./constants.js" file to write addresses and ABI to have consistency.
Add localhost network to Metamask


Notes:
In front-end javascript you can't use `require()`. You have to use `import()`
`require()` is used in nodejs language.
Things needed to send a transaction:
1. Provider aka connection to the blockchain (need `ethers`)
2. Signer aka wallet aka someone with some gas
3. Contract that we are interacting with (Need ABI & Address for a contract)
